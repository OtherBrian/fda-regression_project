# Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Regression

This repository contains Brian Doheny's project submission for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis 2020 module at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT).

This repository contains the following three files:
* README.md - this file you are currently reading.
* Regression Project.ipynb - A Jupyter Notebook going through the steps of how to perform regression analysis on the turbine_output.csv dataset. Includes Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree Regression and KNN Regression.
* turbine_output.csv - A CSV file containing the power output of a wind turbine at various wind speeds. This CSV was provided as part of the assignment, and no edits have been made to it since.
* .gitignore
